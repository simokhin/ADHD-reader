# Idea

Many people struggle to concentrate when reading continuous text, especially in keeping their eyes focused on the sentence they are currently reading. This can be due to ADHD, dyslexia, or vision problems (such as astigmatism).

My method is simple: the text is split into sentences and displayed one at a time (when you press the spacebar), with the current sentence highlighted in color. This makes reading easier and helps to follow the flow of the text.

## How it works

- Paste the text you want to read.
- Press the spacebar or the “Next” button — sentences will appear one by one.
- Save important fragments to notes if needed (an account is required for this).

## Features

- **Sentence-by-sentence reading**: Focus on one sentence at a time to improve comprehension.
- **Highlighting**: The current sentence is highlighted for better visibility.
- **Notes**: Save key fragments for later reference.
- **User accounts**: Create an account to save and manage your notes.

## Stack

- **Next.js**: Framework for server-rendered React applications.
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Prisma ORM**: Database toolkit for managing data.
- **Better Auth**: Secure and user-friendly authentication system.
